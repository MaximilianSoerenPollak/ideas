### CLI Training tool for DSA with Go & Python 

It feels that Go is obviously not the best language for DSA but I still need to learn them either with Go or python.

Now this probably first requieres much better understanding of DSA etc. before I can build it, but maybe it could be a rather small oen that I then expand etc.
